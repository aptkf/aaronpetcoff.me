Okay, so I completely redesigned and rebuilt my personal site. There are a couple of reasons I decided to do this, but mainly because I wanted to give myself an excuse to play with node and build my own static site generator to run my site.

This site is currently built on a pretty primitive static site generator that I built on top of node, Express, and Handlebars. At present, there's no need for any front-end MVC. The code for the static-site generator can be seen (and contributed to) [here on Github](https://github.com/aptkf/semi-static).

The code for this site is more or less identical with some minor customizations that I need to merge into the main repo.

I plan on continuing to maintain and build this project mostly out of a desire to keep learning more about node and server-side JS. I'll continue to blog about what I learn both out of that project and other stuff I'm working on here on this blog.
