_Back in March I spoke at Queens JS where I shared some personal reflections on programming since I started developing about two years ago. I've totally neglected posting my slides and talk since._

## On becoming a developer

I may be preaching to the choir a bit tonight: I want to talk tonight about how important community is for emerging developers.

Just to give you a sense of where I’m coming from: While I began developing as a hobby in high school, I didn’t begin professionally developing until I started a job as a front-end developer at a small agency in Detroit. I moved to New York in August to work in the office of Communications and Marketing at the New York Institute of Technology. In March, I’ll be leaving NYIT to join the development team at New York magazine.

To be sure, a lot of my observations come from the perspective of someone who, so far, has only really been a part of very small development teams.

Nevertheless, what I want to talk about will be familiar to most of you. I think all of us probably face or have faced some of the challenges I’ll be talking about and have developed our own strategies for working through them, and have come to similar conclusions about the critical importance of a healthy and vibrant development community.

My hope is that what I have to say tonight will appeal to both newer and more experienced developers.

I hope that newer developers will find some of my observations helpful in thinking about your own growth and advancement in the future.

For more experienced developers – I hope that these notes can help you reflect.

I wanted to speak tonight about community particularly because I have been so impressed and thankful for the developer community here in New York – in particular the people around in the local JS and Sass communities.  And wanted to share some considerations on what’s made the scene here so helpful.

## #tl;dr

The quick tl;dr of what I want to get across here is that our field – like any field – produces its own anxieties and stresses. Being upfront about your questions and challenges and being engaged with a community of developers is the most effective remedy for those stresses.

## #Why Development

To open up, I think it’d be helpful to start with what makes our field pretty great.

* Our field is exciting. There’s always an opportunity to learn something new or build something great.
* We make useful things We make things that are useful to people by helping them access information, make things more convenient, or entertain them.
* My personal favorite. The “ah-ha” moment. This is that moment when everything comes together in your code. It’s like a big high five.

## #Challenges
At its best, engineering rewards curiosity. But it also brings its own burdens and stresses: in particular, I think programming can lend itself to a loud “inner critic” and a tendency to feel as if one has to “know everything.”

The loud “inner critic” is that kind of troll in the back of your mind that bothers you about your code, or your project. It compares you to other developers. Bugs you about why you didn’t think of something first. It’s a real jerk.

The burden of needing to know everything is that tendency that makes you feel that every bug you haven’t heard of or tool you haven’t used is the result of some personal failing.

And of course, these stresses are not unique to our field. But I have a set of hypotheses to suggest that we may be particularly vulnerable:

## #Inner Critic

**Hypothesis**: The program only executes what the developer writes.

Broken code, therefore, remind us of the limitations of the human condition.

Thus spinning us off into an eternal spiral of existential longing and angst.

## #Need to know everything

**Hypothesis**: Our work relies on an ever-growing multitude of skills, disciplines, and talents.

We, therefore, admire the skills, knowledge, and talents of others.

We want their knowledge; and we must have it.

## #Messy combination

These two things can combine into a messy potion, creating the basis for a phenomenon we’ve probably all heard a lot about: **Imposter Syndrome**

This is a condition where – despite all evidence to the contrary – one feels as if they’ve been faking their way through their work and any accomplishments are the result of luck or chance.

The need to “prove” oneself can lead to one feeling as if any moment not spent working or developing is a sign of their “faking it.” This can lead to burnout or pushing oneself out of the field entirely, feeling as if the standard for a “real” programmer is just unrealistically out of reach.

## #Strategies

Thankfully, there are countless ways that people in our field mitigate these stresses.  And for the purposes of this discussion I wanted to kind of parse them out into “personal” and “collective” tactics, with some more emphasis on the latter.

## #Personal strategies

In her article for [A List Apart called "Never Heard of It"](http://alistapart.com/column/never-heard-of-it), Lyza Danger Gardner talks about owning up to “not knowing.” In the article she describes catching herself nodding along or panicking when a colleague or client made reference to some new bit of news or information that she wasn’t yet familiar with. To stop herself she had to learn how to be okay with saying that she didn’t know, “yet.”

It is literally impossible to know everything. It’s helpful to learn how to specialize in a particular field, learning how to reference skills or information you might not need in your day-to-day work, and recognizing that mastery of our craft comes with time and patience.

It’s also important to make a lot of time for experimentation. At my last job, room to grow and develop my skills on the job were constrained by a quick turnaround time on development projects. Giving myself projects outside of work was a great way to try new technologies that – in a lot of cases – I could then turn around and bring back into our toolset at the office. I craved new projects: I once made a site for a friend’s visual arts project in return for some fancy cheeses she snagged from her day job.

Finally, it’s crucial that one learns how to give themselves credit. Which, unfortunately, is often harder than it sounds.

## #Community

But in addition to developing your own personal strategies, finding a community of developers can be a powerful resource to emerging developers.

A community can provide mentorship, guidance, a group off whom to bounce ideas and questions, or to gain feedback from. Being a part of a community of developers means that one can “check-in” with others – instead of being left to just your “inner critic.”

A community can help new developers entering the field gain a better sense of the range of conversations, discussions, and debates. Conversations with more experienced developers can help you figure out what tool or skill to learn next. And these are people who can work with you over a long period of time.

It can give one a sense of the various “ways” one can actually “be” a developer – in other words, the different areas, skills, talents, and technologies one can focus their growth on.

A wider community can also open up opportunities to share what you know. Developers or engineers with more experience might not necessarily know about the frameworks or technologies you’ve taught yourself. A new developer might have taken to learning Ember or Sass while a more experienced developer might not.

Being able to teach or to share your ideas or what you’ve learned with a group is an especially powerful pedagogical tool – it forces you to organize your own thoughts and ideas in order to be explicit and understandable to others.

## #Long term benefits community

A healthy and vibrant development community is something that can build on top of itself. By being a powerful resource for emerging developers, it can provide a strong foundation of support to the projects that come out of it.

In a recent article on Sitepoint called, "[On Code and Community](http://www.sitepoint.com/on-code-and-community/)", Una Kravets discusses what happens in a healthy development community – referencing the community around Sass – noting, that among other things, projects built by a strong community become more actively and thoroughly tested, are more well documented, and (relatedly) more widely used.  This was the advantage, according to Kravets, that Sass has over other pre-processors.

In that vein, Kravets, recommends a few things that I think are incredibly helpful to ensuring an engaged and inclusive community. For instance: making sure to have and enforce a strong code of conduct. And having active ways of connecting people together such as an IRC or Slack chat.

## #Conclusions

Closing things out, I’ll just reiterate that I’ve been tremendously lucky to have found a great community of developers and colleagues in Detroit and here in New York. I’m looking forward to really building some amazing stuff with you all. Thanks again.
