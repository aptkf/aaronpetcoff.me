Git deployment has been covered pretty thoroughly by a number of writers ([here](http://someguyjeremy.com/blog/quick-and-dirty-git-deployment "Quick and Dirty Git Deployment") are [two](http://www.arlocarreon.com/blog/git/push-git-repo-into-shared-hosting-account-like-hostgator/ "Push Git Repo Into Shared Hosting Account")). Nevertheless, I thought I'd contribute my own experience to the collection of articles and resources out there, specifically as it regards Wordpress deployment.
