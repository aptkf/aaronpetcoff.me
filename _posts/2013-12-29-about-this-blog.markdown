This blog is intended as a space for me to think through various questions and challenges that I come across as I grow as a front end web developer.

I often like to think out loud, and writing has always been a great outlet for processing the thing I'm learning. So the hope is that this blog will help me do that for web development and design.

I also hope to build different pages here that will let me experiment with different things I'm testing out, creating, etc.
