I'm a web developer from Detroit, MI currently living in Brooklyn. I work in the office of Communications + Marketing at the New York Institute of Technology's Manhattan campus. I'm currently excited about experimenting with node, MVC frameworks, and generally all things Javascript related.

I occasionally do freelance work in my spare time. If you have a project you think I could contribute to [please contact me](mailto:hello [ at ]  aaronpetcoff [ dot ] me).
