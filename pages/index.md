<div class="home-image"><img src="/img/about.jpg" alt="Aaron Petcoff"></div>
I'm a web developer from Detroit living in Brooklyn who is excited about all things Javascript. I work at the office of Communications + Marketing at the New York Institute of Technology.

In my free time, I could be caught reading history and poetry, running in Prospect Park, or listening to records. I'm passionate about social, global, and environmental justice.

I'm always open to discussing freelance opportunities. If you think you have a project I'd be interested in, [contact me](mailto:hello [ at ]  aaronpetcoff [ dot ] me).
