I am an ambitious web developer whose passion is learning new technologies, working with new people, and trying to make the web (and the world) a better place.
</h2>

You'll currently find me in the Office of Communications + Marketing at the New York Institute of Technology's Manhattan campus where I specialize in the development and maintenance of web content. I write about what I do [on my blog](/blog/).

I live with my partner and two cats in Brooklyn. If you catch me in my free time there's a good chance I'll be reading history, running in Prospect Park, or listening to punk and hip-hop records. And social, global, and environmental justice are pretty important, too.

I'm always open to discussing freelance opportunities. [I'd love to hear more](mailto:hello [ at ]  aaronpetcoff [ dot ] me) about your project.
