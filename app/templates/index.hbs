  <p>You&#39;ll currently find me at <a href="http://nymag.com"><i>New York</i> magazine</a>, where I build beautifully designed experiences and thoughtfully engineered publishing systems while contributing to open source.</p>
  <p>I live in Brooklyn with my partner and two cats. In my free time I enjoy reading history, sci-fi, and poetry, running in Prospect Park, and listening to records. I believe social, economic, and global justice are important. I write occasionally about what I do {{#link-to "blog" title="Blog"}}on my blog{{/link-to}}.</p>
